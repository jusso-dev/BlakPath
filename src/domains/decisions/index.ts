/**
 * Decisions domain (Phase 5).
 *
 *   - `tally`   — pure status + vote-counting (advisory only; never decides).
 *   - `schemas` — zod v4 input validation.
 *   - `service` — tenant-scoped, permission-checked, audited path with conflict
 *     guards; finalising drives the application to `decided`.
