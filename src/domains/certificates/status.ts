/**
 * Certificate status rules — pure and testable.
 *
 * A certificate is `draft` when generated, `signed` once an authorised human
 * signs it (with step-up), and `revoked` if later withdrawn. Only a signed,
 * non-revoked certificate is valid or downloadable.
 *
 * PRODUCT INVARIANT: a certificate may only be generated from a decision that
 * authorised humans FINALISED with a `confirmed` outcome. There is no path that
 * computes or infers that outcome — `eligibleDecision` merely checks the human
 * decision already recorded in Phase 5.
