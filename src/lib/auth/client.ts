/**
 * Better Auth browser client for BlakPath.
 *
 * SECURITY INTENT
 * ---------------
 * This runs in the browser. It carries NO secrets — authentication state lives
 * in httpOnly cookies the client cannot read, and every privileged decision is
 * re-made and audited on the server. The client only initiates flows (sign in,
 * enrol a passkey, verify a TOTP code) and reflects reactive session state.
 *
 * `baseURL` is intentionally omitted: the app is served from the same origin as
 * the auth API (`/api/auth/*`), so same-origin requests keep cookies scoped to
 * this origin and avoid a cross-origin surface.
 *
 * The `onTwoFactorRedirect` hook routes a partially-authenticated user (correct
 * password, second factor still owed) to the verification screen. It exposes no
 * secret and makes no authorisation decision — it is navigation only.
