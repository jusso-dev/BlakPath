 * Staff multi-factor authentication policy.

 * ---------------
 * Any account that can act on behalf of an authorised organisation — reviewing
 * applications, handling evidence, issuing outcomes — is "staff" and MUST hold
 * a second factor. A single stolen password must never be enough to reach
 * sensitive cultural and personal information. The preferred factor is a
 * phishing-resistant WebAuthn passkey; TOTP with recovery codes is accepted as
 * an alternative.
 *
 * This module is split into a PURE decision function (easily unit-tested, no
 * I/O) and a thin async guard that gathers the enrolment facts from the
 * database. Keeping the decision pure means the rule is auditable in one place
 * and cannot drift between call sites.
