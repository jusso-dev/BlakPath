/**
 * Enterprise SSO / provisioning abstraction.
 *
 * DESIGN INTENT (this is an extension point, NOT an insecure placeholder)
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Phase 1 ships with email+password and MFA only. Some authorised
 * organisations will later require federated sign-in (OIDC / SAML — e.g.
 * Microsoft Entra ID, Google Workspace) and directory provisioning (SCIM).
 * This module defines the stable contract those integrations will implement and
 * a registry to look them up by key.
 *
 * The registry is deliberately EMPTY by default. That is a secure posture: with
 * no providers registered, `resolveSsoProvider` returns `null` and federated
 * sign-in is simply unavailable — there is no default, no "accept anyone",
 * no bypass of the password/MFA path. A real provider is only ever available
 * once it has been explicitly, deliberately registered.
 *
 * A future domain rule will additionally gate provider *selection* per tenant:
 * an organisation must opt in to a specific IdP and that binding must be
 * verified (see `organisationDomains`) before any of its members can federate.
 * That tenant-binding logic lives in the tenancy/identity layer, not here — this
 * file only models the provider capability itself.
