# Authorisation matrix

Access in BlakPath is **always permission-checked**. A user's mere existence
grants nothing. Access flows only from: an **active membership** of an
organisation → **roles** held within that membership → **permission keys**
bundled by those roles — all scoped to a single tenant
(`src/db/schema/membership.ts`).

> BlakPath never determines Aboriginality. No permission grants a power to
> auto-decide, score, rank or infer identity. The most a role can do is let an
> authorised human **record** a decision that human has made.

## How it fits together

- **Permissions** (`permissions` table): the catalogue. `key` is the stable
  identifier checked at every gate (e.g. `application:read-assigned`), with a
  `category` and human `description`.
- **Roles** (`roles` table): bundles of permissions. A role with a null
  `organisation_id` is a reusable **system template**; a tenant-owned role
  carries the tenant's `organisation_id`. `isSystem` marks built-ins that must
  not be deleted.
- **Role → permission** (`role_permissions`): which keys a role grants.
- **Membership → role** (`membership_roles`): which roles a member holds.

A permission check resolves the caller's membership, collects the permission
keys from their roles, and confirms the required key is present — the resolved
set is cached on the verified `TenantContext.permissions`
(`src/lib/tenancy/context.ts`).

## Permission key catalogue

Permission keys are namespaced `resource:action`. This is the Phase-1 catalogue;
domains added later extend it, never bypass it.

| Category       | Key                                 | Description                                              |

Notes:

- **Org Admin** manages people and configuration but is deliberately **not**
  granted `decision:record`, `decision:review` or `certificate:issue` by
  default — administrative power is separated from determination power.
- **Auditor** is read-only oversight: audit and role visibility, no data
  mutation and no case access.

## Separation-of-duties rules

Enforced in domain services on top of the permission check:

1. **No self-review.** The user who holds `decision:record` on an application
   cannot be the same user who provides `decision:review` for it. Reviewer and
   Certifying Officer must be distinct people.
2. **Record vs certify are distinct powers.** `decision:record` (Reviewer) and
   `certificate:issue` (Certifying Officer) are held by different roles; issuing
   a certificate requires an existing recorded, reviewed decision.
3. **Admin does not adjudicate.** Managing members/roles/settings
   (`organisation:*`, `membership:*`, `role:*`) does not by itself confer
   `decision:record` or `certificate:issue`.
4. **Granting representative access is not self-serving.** A user cannot grant
   themselves representative access to another person's application.
5. **Auditor cannot edit.** `audit:read`/`audit:verify` never accompany mutating
   case permissions in the same role.

## Contextual policies

Permission keys answer "may this role do this kind of thing"; contextual policies
answer "for this specific record, right now":

- **Assignment scoping.** `application:read-assigned` only returns applications
  where the caller is the assigned caseworker; `application:read-all` is required
  to see the rest.
- **Tenant scoping.** Every check runs inside a verified `TenantContext`; a
  permission only ever applies within the caller's own organisation
  (`docs/tenant-isolation.md`).
- **Membership status gate.** A membership must be `active`
  (`membership_status`) for any of its permissions to apply; `invited`,
  `suspended` and `revoked` confer nothing.
- **Evidence readiness.** `evidence:read` only serves objects that have passed
  scanning and been promoted; quarantined objects are never served regardless of
  permission (`docs/evidence-scanning-design.md`).
- **Representative time-boxing.** Representative access is honoured only while the
  `representative_authorisations` grant is `active` and unexpired/unrevoked, and
  (when the consent domain lands) tied to a consent record.
- **Step-up for sensitive actions.** Actions such as `decision:record`,
  `certificate:issue`/`certificate:revoke` and break-glass require a recent
  successful authentication (`sessions.lastAuthenticatedAt`); see
  `docs/authentication.md`.
- **Break-glass, not standing access.** Platform operators
  (`users.isPlatformOperator`) hold **no** tenant permissions. Cross-tenant
  access is only ever granted through an approved, time-boxed, tenant-notified
  break-glass request (`break_glass_requests`).

Every check — permitted, **denied**, or errored — is written to the audit trail
with the acting role recorded (`docs/audit-log-design.md`).
